# Advanced Prompt Engineering

This repository is a collection of advanced prompt engineering techniques for OpenAI's API. This code is an implementation of the course of the same name. The course originally do not have code, by I'm adding it to make it easier to understand the concepts.

The code is seperated into contextual sessions, and each session has a assigment.

- Session 1: In-Context Learning
- Session 2: Thought Generation
- Session 3: Problem Decomposition Prompting
- Session 4: Self-Criticism Prompting
- Session 5: Tools
